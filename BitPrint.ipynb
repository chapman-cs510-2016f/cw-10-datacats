    "In a Jupyter notebook BitPrint.ipynb, describe what print_types does in detail: \n",
    "\n",
    "Print_types takes a value that the user inputs then assigns that character into many different types and outputs it. The reason for is to see how a particular character is stored in memory depending on its' type and this in turn allows the user to see which type is most efficient for the given character and also in general. This excersie allows us to see how C stores variables and how we can efficiently store certain variables for our codes. \n",
    "Our print_types only handles integer numbers. If a string is inputted, it assigns the character to the value 0. If a string of a number is passed in, that number will be converted to an integer through the code itself ie the function 'atoi' in the main function. It does not matter if a number is passed in as a integer or a character, however it does matter if a letter is passed in. \n",

    "Unsigned integers use binary numbres which use base 2 and is 16 bits long, and assignes a specific binary code (the bit string) to each integer value. If we start at 0 for example, it's bit string will be 0000000000000000, or 16 zeros. For each number after, a 1 is added to the 16 bit string at the end, and that will be each number's specific bit string value. \n",

    "The algorithm for signed integers is the same as for unsigned with the difference being signed integer variables can handle negative values. While storing positive values is the same as with unsigned integers, for negative values, instead of starting with 16 zeros as the initial bit string, it will reverse the order and start with 16 ones, for the value -1, with each sequential negative value, the number 1 is added to the end of the bit string and assigned accordingly. This method is called the 2's complement encoding, and also preserves binary addition. \n",
